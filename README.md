# Introduction
Batch effects are unwanted sources of data variation that obscure biological signals. How to eliminate batch effects effectively is one of the biggest challenges in omics data analysis. BatchServer is an open-source R-based web server that enables interactive evaluation and automatic correction of batch effects for a variety of large-scale omics data sets.
