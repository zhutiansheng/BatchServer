Batch effects are one of the biggest challenges faced by high throughput omics science, especially in the context of large cohort of thousands of samples. Existing batch effect-correcting tools focus mainly on the development of methods that are not convenience of use, usually requiring extensive coding experiences, sometimes even need to know the prior distribution of the data. Moreover, few tools offer both evaluation and correction of batch effects. We developed an open-source web server-based batch effect correction tool, namely BatchServer, which enables users to interactively evaluate and correct batch effects of a variety of omics data.')
